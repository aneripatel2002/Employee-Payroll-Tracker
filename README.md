Employee Payroll Tracker

I have created this page to help the payroll manaager enter employee names and their salaries. The end results help HR team with monitoring salaries and prepape employee budgets.

How to use:
1. Enter employee's first name
2. Enter employee's last name
3. Enter employee's salary
4. Repeat the process as many time as needed. 
5. Once all the entries are done, hit cancle button and it will populate the entire list.

I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to complete this challange.

The following images show the web application's appearance and functionality:
